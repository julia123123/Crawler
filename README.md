This project revolves around creating a Python-based web scraper that automates the process of logging into my school's official website and fetching graduation threshold information. It's designed to streamline the retrieval of essential academic requirements using automation and web scraping techniques.

Key Features:

Automated School Website Login: Enter your credentials once to automatically log into the school's online portal.

Retrieve Graduation Thresholds: The scraper navigates the school's website to extract details such as credit requirements, mandatory courses, GPA standards, etc., essential for meeting graduation criteria.

Display and Save Information: The extracted data is presented in an accessible format. You can also save it locally for reference or further analysis.

This project is built using Python, utilizing tools like Selenium for web automation. It aims to provide a straightforward yet effective means for managing and understanding graduation requirements.

This tool is ideal for students like me who need quick access to and a clear understanding of their graduation prerequisites, helping to plan and monitor academic progress efficiently.
